# Get Married On The Blockchain

Smart contract and interface to get married on the blockchain!

## Getting Started

Simply download the required packages from the client folder.

```
npm install

The contracts folder keeps a copy of the contract in Solidity. The migrations folder keeps Truffle deployment files.

### Prerequisites

You must download Truffle in order to compile and migrate updated contracts.

```
npm install -g truffle
```

The Ganache GUI was also used during the development process -> [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache)
